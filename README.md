# Deobfuscation Maps

### Info
A repository for deobfuscation maps for games that contain obfuscated assemblies.\
These maps are able to be used in Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower and Il2CppInterop using the appropriate commands.

### Note
This does **not** contain method names, as they cannot be generated using conventional tools without modifications.

### Supported Games
The only supported game as of right now is VRChat, support is still to be decided for more games like Phasphobia and other obfuscated games.
